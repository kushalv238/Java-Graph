# Graph Algorithms Library

Welcome to the Graph Algorithms Library! üéâ

This Java utility library for Graph data structure contains support for various types of graphs viz. Directed/Undirected, Weighted/Unweighted Graphs, Cyclic/Acyclic Graphs, Connected/Disconnected Graphs, Bipartite Graphs, Complete Graphs etc. With multiple algorithms to use with the Graph data structure, independent use cases of the nodes & edges is also possible for custom algorithms and projects.

## Algorithms

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

## Contributing

With a dream of adding this library in the official Java Collections Framework, I am keeping this project open to contributions ‚òÅÔ∏è‚ú®. Got an idea for an awesome new feature? Found a bug that's been bugging you? Want to add some witty comments of your own? We'd love to hear from you!

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add new feature').
5. Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
6. Create a new Pull Request.

Remember, life is just like a graph: complex, intertwined and confusing but there is always a way around. Sometimes you just need to take a step back (like a breadth-first search) to see the bigger picture, but other times you need to dive deep (like a depth-first search) to uncover the hidden treasures. Happy Graphing! üöÄ
